# Code-TSC-250526

### This repository contains a Python-based testing code designed to evaluate the computational costs of various cryptographic operations. The operations tested include Fuzzy Extractor, Hash function, PUF (Physically Unclonable Function), Scalar-Scalar multiplication, Chebyshev chaotic-map, and Multi-Scalar multiplication. 

### Notably, the Fuzzy Extractor is implemented using the Python fuzzy-extractor library, PUFs are tested using the pypuf library [1], and the Chebyshev chaotic-map is realized following the instantiation method outlined in [2].
